The first step in your integration will be installing WooCommerce to your WordPress storefront.

Once you've logged into your WordPress account, you'll be able to find the Plugins category in the main menu to the left side of the page, commonly just below Appearance. Click on **Plugins** to expand available options before clicking on the revealed option **Add New**.

Under the Install Plugins header, you'll find several options; the second, **Upload**, will enable you to select your .zip of the KORT WooCommerce plugin. Click on the **Choose File** button, and find your .zip of the KORT WooCommerce plugin.

## Configuration
